JSON Parser - Gson

No. One Reason: I am google fanboi

Both Gson and Jackson are arguably the two of the most widely used JSON object serializers and deserializers.
So as I didn't have any experience with JSON, it was logical to choose between the two.

After some research, I decided to user Gson on the following factors:

1. Was originally built inside google and is still maintained by them.
2. Gson is opensource and is actively developed with a large, loyal, comminuty base.
3. Gson has been used in a number of Android apps
4. I refered to the team member in charge of persistence in a previous team project. They used Gson and had recommended it.
